# Test Report

### Test findings â€“ Discoveries
had to test to find the best chance of exit

### Difficulties
The random generator posed an issue with test setup. It wasn't difficult to set up a new generator with a set seed, but knowing that a generator with a seed of 5 will return after running it through the method, meant running the method once with it and taking its result. This meant it was assumed the method was working in the firs tplacce in order to use the ouput as the base line. The only thing this would protect from is if either the workings of the method changed, or if the random generator code changed.  

Abstracting

### What could have been done better

### Observations
A lot of code has needed to be abstracted or operations exposed,
so that more control can be given to testing methods for setting up and verification.  

The visit message was split up into three different functions so that each aspect could be tested individually.
Also, the test messages were made to be global strings so that the testing methods could use them to build the
correct expected string.

### Imposed test limits
With the locations object, little was done to expand its testing. Creating an array of different JSON map files
just to check that the network loader was expansive seemed unessecary. It was only tested to work with the
created Map JSON file and that if the file couldn't be found, that it wont break the system.  

For the testing of the random arguments, extra care was not taken to the boundries of equivalence classes
like 0 - 0.5 - 1, where the boundries are 0-0.49999 0.5-0.999999. This is because it does not matter if the
random generator comes up with 0.24999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 and it returns a 1 instead of
a 2; because thats not the point of the class. Care was taken to test <0 and >=1 however.

Failing tests should be included here, along with why you think that they are failing.
