# Executive Summary

Language
=
The chosen language for this application is Go, which is used by Google. Go is built as a concurrent programming lanaguage to make use of today's multi-core processors; which makes the lanugaue quick and efficent. We want to become familair with Go's code patterns and testing protocols, as Go is a leading trend in the programming community.

Go is a statically typed, compiled language. Go has many built in features such as automated gragbe collection and run-time reflection. Go was developed with the purpose of being clean and concise, which allows programmers to write modular programs. (Documentation, n.d.).

Testing Framework
=
We have selected Go's built in testing language. The testing framework is a package called "Testing" and is part of Go's core library. This means that the testing framework is should be optimised and up-to-date with the GO lanagauge. Third party testing languages are provided within the community as alternatives. The alteratives do not have the official documentation or the large support base that the core testing package has. All things considered, the default framework allows for faster testing development.

The framework has a useful function that allows for automated testing while you work. Automated testing will update the test results when a method has been modified. The framework allows customizable testing execution, but runnning all tests that fit a given regular expression given by the user from the console (Package Testing, n.d.).
