# Executive Summary

Language
-
The chosen language for this application is Go, which is used by Google. Go is built as a concurrent programming lanaguage to make use of today's multi-core processors; which makes the lanugaue quick and efficent. We want to become familair with Go's code patterns and testing protocols, as Go is a leading trend in the programming community.

Testing Framework
-
We have selected Go's built in testing language. The testing framework is a package called "Testing" and is part of Go's core library. This means that the testing framework is should be optimised and up-to-date with the GO lanagauge.
